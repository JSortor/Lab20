		<h2>Blogging</h2>
		<p>  
			Blogging is a new topic for me as a new developer, but what i know so far is it's a great way for me to share the knowledge i have and my experiences in life and as a new developer. It seems like blogging about topics that you have prior experience with is a great way to get started. So for me if I had to choose some topics to get started with I would have to go with football, golf, motorcross, being a new developer, or becoming a new father to twins. The options are unlimited so STAY TUNED FOLKS!!! BIG THINGS COMING!!!!

		<h2>Developing My Future</h2>
		<p>
			So, throughout my life there have been tons of people that asked me what i wanted to do with my future and like many young people my age these days I didnt really have a solid answer for them. For years I had been working in construction and thought I was on to a great career, but as the years past I grew restless and wanted something more out of life. After doing some thorough research I finally stumbled across coding. At first, these new concepts were completely foreign to me but after countless patient hours I grew a passion. What was the new passion?, I didn't know exactly but after more research I found Grand Circus and equipped with their answers to all my questions and a potential future career path with their help, I have never looked back. Now that I am enrolled and attending class everyday I see the future I want is right in front of me. Everyday presents a new challenge for me to continue growing and become a better developer than the day before. This is my favorite part and I cant wait to see what the future holds.

		<h2>Hometown</h2>
		<p>
			Imlay City, MI is where I went to high school but I have lived in a lot of places in my life. As of right now I call Warren, MI home and I am enjoying every second of it because I was originally raised here until the age of 13 and after moving back to the area I met my amazing wife. Now, we are expecting our first children so maybe its a sign that this is my hometown and where I was meant to be all along?. ASNWER TO THIS QUESTION AND A MAP OF MY HOMETOWN COMING SOON!!!!
