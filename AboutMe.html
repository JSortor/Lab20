				Hello, My name is Justin Sortor, I am a very hard working, honest, C# .Net developer that also has experience in HTML/CSS, javascript, SQL, Git, GitHub, and even java. Currently, I am a student at Grand Circus in the January 2019 C# .Net bootcamp. I will be graduating in March of 2019 and as a new developer, I am looking to hit the ground running. So i have put togeother this basic HTML/CSS website to display the links to my completed projects on my GitHub accoount, which you can find on my portfolio page. Furthermore, if you have any questions or would like me to tackle your next big project, check out my contact links above. Thank you, and I look forward to taking on any and all projects you have.
